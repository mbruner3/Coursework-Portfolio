# Coursework-Portfolio
Portfolio of Coursework Projects

I have included some of the projects I found most interesting on topics of interest to me.

1. Operations Research:
    * Class Group Project Optimization: I seek to create optimal groups for a class project using linear programming.
    * Panera Casier Optimization: Using Arena software, I personally collected data from a local Panera and made recommendations on the number of cashiers during peak business hours.
2. Data Mining:
    * Car Seat Price Analysis: I use a generalized linear model to find the optimal price for a car seat based upon shelf location in a store.
