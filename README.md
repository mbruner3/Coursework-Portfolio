# Coursework-Portfolio
**Portfolio of Coursework Projects**

I have included some of the projects I found most interesting on topics of interest to me.

1. Data Mining:
    * Car Seat Price Analysis: I use a generalized linear model to find the optimal price for a car seat based upon shelf location in a store.
2. Deep Learning:
    * LSTM Model to Predict No. of Hospital Cases: I used a NN to predict the number of cases a hospital would have based upon time series data.
4. Machine Learning
   *  Segementing Consumers with KMeans Clustering: I use a clustering algorithm to determine loyal customers from those who are only looking for good deals.  
5. Operations Research:
    * Report Scheduler: I used Linear Programming to create a report build scheduler to minimize build times.
    * Panera Casier Optimization: Using Arena software, I personally collected data from a local Panera and made recommendations on the number of cashiers during peak business hours.
